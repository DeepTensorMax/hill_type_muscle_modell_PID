# hill_type_muscle_model_PID

A MATLAB implementation of the Hill-type muscle model based on [Zajac, 1989](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24612719/). This project simulates the **biceps brachii muscle** and controls arm movement using a **PID controller**, all implemented without the use of Simulink.

## Features

- Implementation of the Hill-type muscle model in MATLAB.
- PID controller for arm movement simulation.
- Visualization of the controller and computational pipeline.

## Model Purpose

The goal of this project is to simulate the behavior of the biceps brachii muscle and demonstrate how a PID controller can regulate its movement in a simplified computational model.

## Computational Pipeline

Below are figures illustrating the PID controller structure and the overall computational pipeline:
